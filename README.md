# 🎵 StorySong

**Tagline:**  
We’re building a platform that brings transparent ownership and monetization to AI-generated music using Web3.

## 🧠 Problem It Solves

### 🎤 Opaque Ownership  
Traditional music industry models have long suffered from unclear ownership rights and revenue sharing structures.

### 🤖 AI Evolution  
With tools like **Suno** and **Udio**, anyone can now generate music that’s nearly indistinguishable from human-made content—ushering in a new wave of music creation.

### ⚖️ Ownership Gap  
There is currently no easy, trustworthy, and decentralized way to **claim**, **license**, and **trade** ownership of AI-generated music.

While various Web3 projects have attempted to address this issue, none have successfully bridged the gap between creators and transparent monetization. But with AI now capable of producing full-fledged musical content, **ownership and royalty management** for AI-generated works is no longer a niche issue—it's inevitable.

## 💡 What We Built

**StorySong** leverages **NFTs and Story chain** to provide:

- Clear ownership of AI-generated tracks  
- Seamless licensing and royalty configuration  
- Monetization opportunities for creators and transparency for fans  

Fans can support the musicians behind AI-generated music, and musicians can earn directly through blockchain-based licensing and royalty mechanisms.
